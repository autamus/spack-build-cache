# Spack Build Cache

Have you ever wanted to easily create a build cache, but you aren't so keen about
dishing over your credit card to AWS or GCP? Me too! This is a spack build cache
that is entirely powered by GitHub. That means that packages are built and then
served via GitHub workflows, packages, and pages. It's powered by 
[vsoch/spack-package-action](https://github.com/vsoch/spack-package-action).

> Will it work?

Probably not, but trying anyway.
